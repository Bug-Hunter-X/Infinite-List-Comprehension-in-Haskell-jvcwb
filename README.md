This repository demonstrates a common error in Haskell involving the use of infinite lists within list comprehensions. The `bug.hs` file contains the erroneous code, which attempts to filter an infinite list without a terminating condition. This results in the program running indefinitely. The `bugSolution.hs` file provides a corrected version that addresses the issue by using `takeWhile` to limit the evaluation of the infinite list.
