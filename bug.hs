This Haskell code attempts to use a list comprehension with an infinite list, leading to non-termination.  The problem lies in the `filter` function within the list comprehension, which attempts to filter an infinite list (`[1..]`) without a terminating condition.

```haskell
import Data.List

main :: IO ()
main = do
  let evenNumbers = [x | x <- [1..], even x]
  print (take 10 evenNumbers)
```
